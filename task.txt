Task

Given two input files:
    - One-line 12 column tab delimited (FASTQ content)
    - File containing the output from tre-agrep --show-position. 
        The position of a matched substring is given at the begining of each line.

There are 4 possible 50-base matched strings (MS) with 1-fuzzyness. Depending on which of the strings have been located by tre-agrep, we can say whether sequence of interest (SI) is to the right or to the left of the matched string and whether it is in rev_comp.

Left: 	GGGAGGCCG
Left_RC:CGGCCTCCC
 
Right: 		CCTCCCATA
Right_RC: 	TATGGGAGG

# TODO 

Implement:
    - Method to decide whether to discard or keep a read based on 
        - the position of MS 
        - the orientation of MS
        - how many bases of SI are there in the recod (read) 

Testing:
    - Check if methods correctly identify the position of the matched string in the input
    - Check if methods correctly identify L/R, RC or not

    - Docstrings: '''On first line of every method
